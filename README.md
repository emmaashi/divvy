# Divvy
Divvy is a project management tool designed to streamline the process of distributing tasks within a group or team, particularly catering to school group projects. The tool provides features for task management, user performance tracking, and project planning.

# Features
• SQL Database Integration: Utilizes an SQL database to efficiently store and manage user data, project details, and task assignments. This ensures data persistence and the ability to query and update user information, task statuses, and deadlines in real time.
• Dynamic Calendar Interface: Implements a functional calendar to track and manage user deadlines for tasks. The calendar interface is fully interactive, allowing users to easily set, modify, and view task deadlines.

**Development**
• Built using Java, leveraging its Swing library for developing the user interface (UI). UI components such as JLabel, JButton, and JTextField are used for creating a responsive and user-friendly environment.
• The backend is powered by Java, handling task creation, user assignment, and deadlines. It integrates with the SQL database to persist project and user data.
• Java’s Object-Oriented principles ensure scalability and maintainability, with a focus on modularity for future enhancements.
